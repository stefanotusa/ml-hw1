I've worked with assorted datasets in CS475: Machine Learning,
 but no particular one stands out in my memory. I did compile a
small dataset of consisting of song lyrics for Billboard's 
then-current Top 100 Songs  for a personal project that was then
put through some standard NLP pre-processing steps.

In this class, I would like to work with some kind of social
 network data, or perhaps more advanced listening analytics from
a streaming service such as Spotify or Apple Music. 
Generally, I am interested more in sociological,
cultural, or psychological data.
